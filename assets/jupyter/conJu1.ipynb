    "\n",
    "Before we begin, ensure you have Julia installed on your computer. You can download Julia from [the official website](https://julialang.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Julia, you will need to install the `ControlSystems.jl` and `Plots.jl` packages. You can do this by running the following commands in the Julia REPL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "using Pkg\n",

    "## Defining System Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "In control systems, we often represent the system dynamics using either transfer functions or state-space representations. In this section, we will define a simple system and represent it using both forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transfer Function Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "A transfer function represents the relationship between the input and output of a system in the Laplace domain. Here is how you can define a simple first-order transfer function in Julia:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "using ControlSystems\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define a first-order transfer function: G(s) = 1 / (s + 1)\n",
    "G = tf([1], [1, 1])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### State-Space Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "State-space representation provides a more general way to model systems, especially those that cannot be easily represented as transfer functions. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```julia\n",
    "# Define a state-space system: dx/dt = -x + u, y = x\n",
    "A = [-1]; B = [1]; C = [1]; D = [0]\n",
    "sys = ss(A, B, C, D)\n",
